        Lyndsey Scott grew up in West Orange, New Jersey, as the eldest of four children. She attended Amherst College,
        where she studied theatre, economics, and physics, before taking computer science. She graduated Amherst College
        in 2006 with a joint degree in theatre and computer science.

        After college, Scott was more interested in acting than computer science, and began pursuing auditions in New
        York City. With the encouragement of friends, she applied for modeling work, but was turned down by every agency
        she approached for two years; her parents urged her to take up computer science jobs. Scott had, however, put
        her picture on the website Models.com, and in 2008 she was contacted by Click Model Management of New York City.
        Elle Girl featured her in a video about the day of a fashion model, including some of her Click new model
        training. She was then 24, which was considered old for a model. The agency asked her to trim five years from
        her age, and for her first few years modeling she claimed to have been born in 1990. During New York Fashion
        Week, she became the first black model to sign an exclusive runway contract with Calvin Klein.
